This is a Vulnarable web application made with a LOT of common bug bounty concepts and general ways not to pwn.

I STRONGLY RECOMMEND ONLY RUNNING ON A DISCARDABLE VM.
Since LFI and RFI along with RCE vulnarbilities are included

FEATURES:
    BOLA
    LFI via query
    XSS playground (0 santiation whatsoever. I aim to make it toggleable/configurable later on)
    RCE via query.
    IDOR vulnarbilities.
    Bola
